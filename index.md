# Topics

Automatic debugging, error fixing, and reporting is getting more and more popularity across different research communities. We aim to provide a forum for exchange of latest work and document best practices across different disciplines.

* Automatic reproducers like those generated by LLDB
* Automatic unit test extraction and using decorators and code inspection
* Automatic reproducer/error case minimization
* Interactive error recovery systems and their applications
* Error algebras and error-tracing algebras
* Formalizations of debugging
* Fault impact reporting and accuracy estimation
* Provenance tracking in term rewriting
* Error analytics pipelines and databases
* Error monitoring in intrusion detection systems
* Delta debugging
* Automatic generation of error dashboards

## Intended audience

* Experts in automated debugging, error fixing wishing to exchange knowledge with their peers.
* Industry practitioners interested to learn more about approaches to automated analysis of errors.
* Academics in quest for formalization of automated error analysis and fixing
* Financial industry practitioners interested in computer science approaches
  to satisfy risk reporting guidelines with respect to error impact tracing and reporting of accuracy

## Goals

* Our main goal is to encourage social exchange of ideas related to automatic error analysis and impact reporting.
* We call for position papers, research expositions, early stage work, and industry experience papers to encourage
  exchange of on-going research and implementation efforts.

# Submissions

We welcome original, unpublished papers of the following forms: full articles, extended abstracts, case studies.


Please submit your paper or extended abstract by EasyChair.
You may [contact the committee chair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjgajda/) with any questions you have about submission.

The paper evaluation will use the following criteria:
* Novelty
* Clarity of exposition
* Transferrability of innovation(s) to other domains
* Scientific rigour and form of the article
* Cross-pollination potential with other papers
* Preliminary papers will be offered feedback on how to improve the quality in all these factors before and during the workshop

All submissions should use [ACM DL template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

# Proceedings
Like other workshops of the conference, we plan to include selected papers in ACM DL post-proceedings.
